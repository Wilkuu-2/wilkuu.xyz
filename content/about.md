# Who am I? 
Well, I'm Jakub. 

I like messing with computers, and I'm somehow good at it.  
This consists of solving problems by making programs in any language or breaking software that wronged me.

Aside from a hobby, computers are also part of my Computer Science/Cybersecurity master degree, I'm pursuing. 
And aside of computers, I also manage some students managing computers, by being board of [Studenten Net Twente](https://snt.utwente.nl)

I also like drawing on the side... 

# What do I do? 
Currenly, I am studying at the University of Twente, and being active as a board member there. 
I finished my bachelor in Creative Technology by making a cool *Laravel* project involving maps and people making criteria sets. 

So, programming, hacking or supporting hackers and programmers is something that I do actively and would also like to do after I am done with university. 
Currently I am unemployed but I'd like to change that next year. 

I am also actively trying to learn about maintaining my own set of services for personal use and as a way to learn, so things like using Linux, Docker and other common sysadmin tools come semi-naturally by now. I also daily drive NixOS, although that's still a bit weird to use still. 

# Any other projects I can show? 
I still need to write about some of my projects that I did over the years. 
But despite the current lack of things on the site, you can find some projects [here](../projects).

# Anything I am making now? 
There are some minor projects I am doing still, like updating this website, cleaning up things, setting up my own Mikrotik router and writing a Rust crate. 
I hope to get some articles about those projects soon! 

Most of my projects are moving along quite slowly, but I hope to change that as I settle into the Master degree flow. 
I will try to use the [`#in-progress`](/tags/in-progress) tag for any active projects in the future. 

# Amazing story? Contact me. 
I currently do not accept e-mail for spam reasons, I might make a web( or SSH)-based form in the future.
