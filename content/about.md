I am somehow good at computers. I like solving problems by making programs in any language. 

I am studying Creative Technology at the University of Twente and am almost done with the Bachelor.
Currently busy with the graduation project. 

In addition I am part of the board for Studenten Net Twente, which manages servers for other student associations on the university.
