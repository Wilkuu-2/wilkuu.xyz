### About

In 2023, I created a summary for one of the most infamous courses in Creative Technology. This summary was quite incomplete, but it did its job and I got a lot of good reviews for it. 
Because of the good feedback I sent it to the people who were doing this subject in 2024, but apparently I sent an older version?

The ODT file seems to miss some of the summary, which is weird, but not that unexpected, seeing how good I am at archiving data. 
Here is the original version, which has all the content I have written at the time. 

2023 Version: [here](/docs/inttech_2023.pdf) 

In order to send it to the Education Committee, I want to finish the summary, you will be able to see it here when I finish it.  

2024 Version: [here](/docs/inttech_2024.pdf)
