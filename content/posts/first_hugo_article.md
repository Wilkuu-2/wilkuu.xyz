I really overcomplicated life for myself. I used a lot of backend frameworks, from Warp to Axum and things inbetween (I was a little bit too into Rust).
But all I needed is a simple site where I can type stuff down. And this is it, a Hugo site where I can put in my thoughts and they should be automatically put into the interwebs using GitHub actions. 
Amazing how simple things can be so efficient. 

The issue of overcomplicating things might have been a question of Ego and me wanting to make something I could call my own. With no experience in web I tried to make something, and just making something costs too much energy, apparently. And because I'm also a student, this did not combine well and I started procrastinating on it, so in the end I got no site. And the worst of all is that people were telling me that I was overcomplicating things and I ignored it, which is really sad.
